### 🐈 Fun Fact About Me (and my cat Shadow)

My free time, and often busy time, is spent with my very clingy cat, Shadow. He is almost 8 years old, and I have had him since he was a kitten. Shadow moved to Connecticut with me from New Jersey in 2023 for grad school. He loves treats and does everything he can to get pets from me. (Including sitting on books/computer while I am working!)
